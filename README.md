# AI_Email_Sender

AI Email Sender
A simple full-stack application that leverages the power of Large Language Models to generate and send emails. The user provides a prompt, the AI generates the email body, the user can edit it, and then send it to the specified recipients.

This project was built as a timed assignment to demonstrate rapid development and full-stack capabilities.

‚ú® Key Features
AI-Powered Content Generation: Uses the Groq API with the Llama 3 model to generate email content based on a user's prompt.

Editable Output: The AI-generated email body is fully editable, allowing the user to make adjustments before sending.

Simple, Clean UI: A single-page interface built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look and feel.

FastAPI Backend: A lightweight and high-performance Python backend to handle API requests.

Simulated Email Sending: A backend endpoint that simulates the email sending process, logging the details to the console.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture / Workflow
The application follows a simple client-server architecture. The frontend is a static HTML file that communicates with a Python backend, which in turn communicates with the external Groq AI service.
